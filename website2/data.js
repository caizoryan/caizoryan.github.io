    description: `Everybody loves a good problem solver. Whether it's resolving conflict, figuring out how to fit everything into the trunk, or showing up to a boring party with beer and music, problem solvers are loved and cherished for the tremendous stress-relieving work they do. So what better way to challenge yourself at problem-solving than putting together a picture bit by bit made up of a thousand unique pieces? You may want to rip your hair out when it comes to the all-blue sky but trust me when say it will be worth it when you finish. After I finish a puzzle I like to put tape on the back of it to keep all the pieces together then I hang it up on my wall of puzzles.
If puzzles aren’t really your thing don’t worry! It’s all right. Just remember Be You!`,

    title: `Learn how to shuck oysters well.`,
    description: `A seemingly worthless skill to have, oyster shucking is the hidden gem of being interesting. Now imagine this scenario. You and your friends decide you want to have an oyster night but after a diligent few hours of reading reviews and looking at prices for the best oyster places in town, you come to the realization that every restaurant is too expensive. Instantly the mood is killed. Everyone is disappointed. That's when you say “Hey! I know how to shuck oysters. Let's just buy some from the fish market.”
A twinkle of hope shines in the eyes of your friends. The night may still be saved. You are the hero of the night, the coolest guy around, the oyster shucker. Now you’ve talked the talk, but can you walk the walk? Writing yourself off as this intriguing and mysterious shucker of the shell may backfire when you’re friends see you stabbing yourself with the oyster knife or when you get lots of tiny little bits of shell in torn apart poorly shucked oysters. Don’t let that happen. Remember, you’re the hero of the party. When you shuck a perfect dozen, people cheer and whistle, they start chanting your name, everyone wants to talk to you. Congratulations, you’ve done it. You’ve saved the night, the party and your friend's craving for oysters.
So Practise. Practise. And practise some more. First, buy yourself a good oyster shucking knife. You may have to go through a few before you find one that really clicks with you. Then keep buying five oysters a week until you finally get good at getting a well-shucked oyster 80% of the time. Take your time when shucking and don’t rush yourself. The goal is to get good first. Speed will come naturally. Most importantly, when you’re done shucking and you start to chat, remember to
Be You!`,

    description: `This is a weird one but oddly true. I guarantee anyone who sees your phone will ask “why is it so big?”. Most people just keep it at the factory-set size and don’t think twice. If you’re super old then sorry, this isn’t interesting, just normal. That’s why it's weird for young people to have really really big text font.
Personally, I do it because it’s easier on the eyes. Be You!`,

    title: `Go see a movie late at night by yourself`,
    description: `If you want to take it to the next level arrive an hour before your movie starts. Play a little pinball in the arcade (because pinball is awesome and when’s the last time you played with a real pinball machine?!). You still have an hour before your movie starts. Walk into any movie that has already started playing and you’re curious about it. You’ll get to watch a decent chunk of the movie so the next time you decide to go to the theatres you can know if you’d like to see the movie or not. You’ve already paid to get in and you’re not hurting anyone so it’s not that bad.
Trust me when I say it will be a wonderful time to Be You!``Go to a fancy restaurant and treat yourself.``It’s okay to go out and get dinner by yourself. Treating yourself to a fancy meal is a great way to show self-love. Enjoy the quiet and get an extra appetizer or dessert or maybe even both to take home for tomorrow's lunch.
Just go out and have a good time. Be You!``You’re sitting down at the bar with your date``and your handsome/beautiful date is sitting across from you talking about this great book they are reading, how they’re totally obsessed with it and you you absolutely have to read it. You may not even like reading but the way your date lights up when they talk about the book, the engaging and fun conversation that came from the topic has you on your phone ordering the book on amazon. I’d like to think we’ve all been on a date where the person you’re talking to speaks so passionately about something that you immediately invest in it. I’ve ended up buying lots of books and movies like this. It could be about a topic you’ve never heard of or cared for but all of a sudden you’re interested. Why is that? You could have lived your entire life without ever hearing about this book and it would make no difference but now you want this book, or movie or whatever it is, you need this item, even though deep down you still really don’t care. It’s not that the object has suddenly become interesting, it’s that your date is so interesting that you are drawn into whatever they are talking about.
That’s the thing about interesting people, they could talk about shit on a stick and all of a sudden you'd be interested in shit on a stick. Interesting people are fun, they socialize, interact, listen, and participate. Somehow they get you involved in whatever conversation they start. Interesting people always have something to say and two cents to give, after all, you’ll never meet an interesting person who just sits there and is inherently interesting. So ask yourself, what is it about interesting people that draws us to them? Is it their charming character? Their intriguing conversations? Or their vast experiences? The answer is all of the above. Interesting people are interesting because they have so many things going for them, there are multiple layers to their character and each time you peel one back you want to peel another. So how does someone become interesting? Well, in theory, it’s actually pretty simple. People often think the process works like this.
Be interesting -------------------> People like you -------------------> Accept yourself
That doesn’t work for a number of reasons. Just because other people like the facade you put on doesn’t mean you will. People don’t usually like facades, to begin with. Like I said before, no one is inherently interesting so it’s impossible to start the process by being interesting. Watch what happens when we change the order up a bit.
Accept yourself -------------------> Be interesting -------------------> People like you
By accepting yourself first you take a lot of pressure off your shoulders. You’re no longer dependent on being interesting or having people like you to validate yourself. You just do it! As a by-product, you become interesting which makes people like you. The trick is simply to accept yourself.
That’s what this blog is about. A number of suggestions and things you can try that can help you discover yourself, self-acceptance and self-love. I hope these things can help you learn to find yourself interesting in the way they helped me discover myself. Even if it’s something you already do, I hope this can be validation that you are already an interesting person! Be positive, believe in yourself, and Be You!`,
