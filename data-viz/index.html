      <a href="withoutNetflix/index.html">Removed Netflix (too big)</a>
      <p>
        Attempted to make it without netlfix since netlfix has a massive

      <a href="multipleBlobs/index.html">Turn money into more smaller blobs</a>
      <p>
        Same logic, money gets divided into different sized blobs
        algorithimicallly (absolutely no idea how to spell that)
